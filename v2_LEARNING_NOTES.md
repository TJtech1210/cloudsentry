## <a name="intro"></a>Intro & Vision for v2
CloudSentry v2 transforms the project into a pre-deployment (IaC-focused) security gate—moving beyond AWS scans to scanning "terraform plan" files, with modular security checks you can expand as you learn. The goal: real DevSecOps, not just read-only reports.
